## Executive Summary
Mr. Smith Johnson has been the owner of a medium-sized distributorship that sells shoes, footwear, and other accessories for more than 5 years. The warehouse consists of shoes from Adidas, Converse, Roxy, Nike, Clarks, Puma, New Balance, Madden Girl, and many more brands, and various kinds of shoe accessories like handbags,  drawstring bags, duffel bags, scarves and wraps, backpacks, assorted socks, polish, laces, even shoe racks. Mr. Smith Johnson’s consumer base is composed of local small shoe stores and thrift stores, individual shoe shiners, and shoe repairers in his district. Over the last few years, his sales have increased leading his business booming. 

When Mr. Smith Johnson started his company ten years ago, he only had 50 customers and an average sale of 25 a week. During that time, it was easier and cheaper to keep his record manually using paper. His system until now consists of keeping customers’ details on index cards in a file box. This system might have been effective back then but now, Mr. Smith Johnson's business has significantly increased with almost 500 customers, an inventory of over 5000 items, and an average of 50 orders per day. This increase in number has drastically changed his business structure. 

Despite all this increase in numbers, Mr. Smith Johnson still uses his old manual bookkeeping. This has led his distributorship to have some business issues, such as out-of-date customer records, an increase in the number of orders resulting in manual processing difficulties, a lack of inventory management, and missed market opportunities. Also. The concept of manually processing orders and checking customer balances is also slowing business growth. These issues are causing sales and income losses, while Mr. Johnson wants to increase his profit by making distribution more efficient and long-lasting. With the technology and digital innovation existing today, he can have a computerized system to help him handle his business better and keep up with his increasing demand. 

## System initiation
### Ishikawa or Fishbone Diagram

### Problem Analysis
The Ishikawa Diagram, also known as the fishbone diagram is a problem-solving and root cause analysis tool. In the contest of Mr. Smith Johnson’s distributorship, defines the root cause of his numerous problems as the use of index cards for customer recited leading to inefficient record keeping and others. 

The first problem with Mr. Smith Johnson's business is customer record management.  With a growing customer base of nearly 500, the existing system of keeping customers’ data on index cards in a file box on the counter is becoming obsolete and inefficient. Because the records are out of date, and difficult to target customers for specific promotions.

Second, he has a problem with inventory management.  The distributorship offers over 5000 items, some of which have been sitting in the warehouse for months. Mr. Johnson is not able to track the trying-to-sell trends of these items, making inventory management difficult and avoiding overstock or excess stock difficult.

Third, he has a problem with order processing. As the number of orders increased (from 25 per week to 50 per day), Mr. Johnson's manual order processing procedures could not keep up with the business's growth. As a result, purchase fulfillment is delayed, and customers are dissatisfied.

Fourth, he has trouble with promoting his business. Due to out-of-date customer information, some promotions fall flat, resulting in sales and income losses. Also, account receivable is another problem the manual process for checking customer account balance and following up on past-due accounts is so overburdened that it's difficult to follow up. 

Finally, the last problem is an increase in competition. As competition grows, Mr. Johnson’s distributorship must become more efficient and up-to-date to stay competitive.

### Scope and Goal 
Mr. Smith Johnson’s business problem extends between the information systems and the outdated technology he uses. The goal is to automate and computerize his system by converting his current index card system into an automated digital platform that will ensure the efficiency of his business. To be able to accomplish his objectives, Mr. Smith Johnson will need the help of a consulting company. After research, I found that BDO Digital LLC. will be the best fit to help him. BDO Digital LLC. is a global consulting company that offers technology and advisory services to organizations of all sizes. They provide a variety of services such as software development, digital transformation, cybersecurity cloud services, etc. In the case of Mr. Johnson Smith, BDO Digital LLC. will help him in four main categories: keep a digital customer record management, have an inventory management system, keep his orders processing, and keep an online presence. This will solve his root problems, increase his numbers, and make his business more efficient.  BDO Digital LLC. will also equip Mr. Johnson Smith with some telecommunication, computer hardware, and technology to improve his information system. 

To get on track with his business new, Mr. Smith Johnson’s main goal is to convert it into a digital platform. In the process of implementing a new management and information system, he needs to make sure to keep all his company’s documentation and records organized in one place. The system should be capable to track inventory and notify them in case of any change or updated data. This will allow him to have control and a broad view over his inventory and products, about what products are not selling much, which ones are popular, and which products he has to restock on. Also, on another point, the system will be automatically updated every time there is an entry, this will keep track of customer accounts with their payment and show the outstanding balance.

Generally speaking, BDO Digital LLC.  can assist Mr. Smith Johnson in improving his business by introducing him to automation and technology. These changes will enable him to keep track of in and outs of his business and make his business use pleasant for his users.

## Systems Analysis
### Procedure 
To keep data organized in place and constantly up to date, there should be a database implementation with access to the internet (cloud-based storage). These changes will involve the implementation of a new system hardware system including mainly a desktop computer and a point-of-sale system.  This is where Mr. Smith Johnson’s business processing system will drastically be transformed from physical paper to a digital system and it will ensure smooth operations.

### Point of Sale Systems 
A point of sale (POS) system is the software and hardware that facilitate sales, accept payment, and check customer records. This allows the company to manage all the transitions, have a detailed list of their customers, and track their inventory and sales. After searching, we found that would be the best platform to host the Point of sale of Mr. Smith Johnson's company.
